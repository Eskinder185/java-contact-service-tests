# Summary and Reflections Report

## Project Overview

This repository includes components from two projects that demonstrate my skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. 

- **Project One**: Contact Service
  - Files: `Contact.java`, `ContactService.java`, `ContactTest.java`, `ContactServiceTest.java`
  - Description: This project involved developing and testing a contact management service to store, retrieve, and manage contact data. I implemented unit tests using JUnit to verify functionality and applied constraints to ensure data integrity.

- **Project Two**: Summary and Reflections Report
  - File: `SummaryAndReflectionsReport.md`
  - Description: This report provides insights into my approach to software testing strategies and quality assurance. It reflects on techniques used, my mindset as a tester, and the lessons learned through the testing process.

Together, these files highlight my approach to unit testing, automation, and quality assurance as I developed software solutions based on user requirements.

## Reflections

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring functionality and security in my software starts with a strong foundation in testing. For the Contact Service, I used JUnit to create unit tests that validate each function and enforce constraints, such as limiting contact ID lengths and requiring non-null fields for names and addresses. To maintain security, I implemented input validation and other practices to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity. My approach emphasizes thorough testing and secure code practices, which ensures that the program meets both functional requirements and security standards.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Understanding and meeting user needs is essential in developing functional and effective software. In Project One, the user's need was a reliable contact management service, which I addressed by building clear, strict validation and constraints within the code. I focused on interpreting the requirements closely to understand the core functionalities needed and iterated on the design to align with user expectations. I often refer back to requirements as I develop to make sure my work stays aligned with the intended use.

### How do I approach designing software?

My approach to software design is centered on modularity, clarity, and adherence to requirements. For the Contact Service, I started with high-level requirements, breaking down the project into smaller classes like `Contact` and `ContactService` with specific roles and responsibilities. This modular structure not only simplifies testing and debugging but also ensures that the code is maintainable and scalable for future development. By focusing on separation of concerns and creating reusable components, I can develop software that is both flexible and robust.
